    "text": "Water is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the worldâ€™s accessible freshwater.\nDeveloping countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issues in many countries globally, especially countries in the Africa continent.\n\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,sf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.1 Import the geospatial dataset\n\ngeoNGA <- st_read(\"data/geospatial/\",\n                  layer = \"geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2\") %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 26392)\n\nReading layer `geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2' from data source \n  `C:\\Quanfang777\\IS415-GAA\\Takehome_Exercise\\Takehome_Exercise1\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 774 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2.668534 ymin: 4.273007 xmax: 14.67882 ymax: 13.89442\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\nNGA <- st_read(\"data/geospatial/\",\n               layer = \"nga_admbnda_adm2_osgof_20190417\") %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 26392)\n\nReading layer `nga_admbnda_adm2_osgof_20190417' from data source \n  `C:\\Quanfang777\\IS415-GAA\\Takehome_Exercise\\Takehome_Exercise1\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 774 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2.668534 ymin: 4.273007 xmax: 14.67882 ymax: 13.89442\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84"
