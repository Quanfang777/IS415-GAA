Adequate Clean water is crucial in promoting a healthy environment, sustaining economic growth in countries. However, a significant portion of the global population, including those in Nigeria, are still grappling with a lack of access to sufficient water resources. Given the critical role that water plays in many aspects of life, it is essential to understand the current water distribution system and identify potential areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nApply appropriate spatial point patterns analysis method to discover the geographical distribution of functional and non-function water points an and their co-locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe package we used for analysis are:\n\nsf: For importing, managing and processing vector-based geospatial data\ntidyverse: For performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\ntmap: used for creating thematic maps, such as choropleth and bubble maps\nraster: reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and models gridded spatial data\nspatstat: used for point pattern analysis\nmaptools: a set of tools for manipulating geographic data\nfunModeling: used for exploratory data analysis\nsfdep: for performing geospatia data wrangling and local colocation quotient analysis.\n\nLet’s load the package required!\n\npacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap,tidyverse,plotly,funModeling,sfdep)\n\nHere are two possible datasets that we can obtain the geospatial information of Nigeria from, one is from Humanitarian Data Exchange portal, the other is from geoBoundaries, let’s read both of the datasets and examine which one is more suitable to use, notice that the crs for Nigeria should be 23692, so we need to assign the crs after reading the data:\n\ngeoNGA <- st_read(\"data/geospatial/\",\n                  layer = \"geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2\") %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 26392)\n\nReading layer `geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2' from data source \n  `C:\\Quanfang777\\IS415-GAA\\Takehome_Exercise\\Takehome_Exercise1\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 774 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2.668534 ymin: 4.273007 xmax: 14.67882 ymax: 13.89442\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\nNGA <- st_read(\"data/geospatial/\",\n               layer = \"nga_admbnda_adm2_osgof_20190417\") %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 26392)\n\nReading layer `nga_admbnda_adm2_osgof_20190417' from data source \n  `C:\\Quanfang777\\IS415-GAA\\Takehome_Exercise\\Takehome_Exercise1\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 774 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2.668534 ymin: 4.273007 xmax: 14.67882 ymax: 13.89442\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nAfter checking both sf dataframes, we notice that NGA provide both LGA and state information.

This is because the default unit of measurement is in meter. As a result, the density values computed is in “number of points per square meter”. so, let’s rescale our KDE values\n\n\n\nLet’s convert the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer.\n\nwp_Osun_functional_ppp.km <- rescale(wp_Osun_functional_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\n\n\nwp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp.km <- rescale(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp, 1000, \"km\")\n\nNow, let’s plot the map after rescaling\n\nkde_Osun_functional.bw <- density(wp_Osun_functional_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel=\"gaussian\")\nplot(kde_Osun_functional.bw)\n\n\n\n\n\nkde_Osun_nonfunctional.bw <- density(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel=\"gaussian\")\nplot(kde_Osun_nonfunctional.bw)\n\n\n\n\nFixed bandwidth method is very sensitive to highly skew distribution of spatial point patterns over geographical units for example urban versus rural. One way to overcome this problem is by using adaptive bandwidth instead.\nThis is the code to compute adaptive bandwidth\n\nwp_Osun_functional_adaptive <- adaptive.density(wp_Osun_functional_ppp.km, method=\"kernel\")\nplot(wp_Osun_functional_adaptive)\n\n\n\n\n\nwp_Osun_nonfunctional_adaptive <- adaptive.density(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp.km, method=\"kernel\")\nplot(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_adaptive)\n\n\n\n\nWe can compare the fixed and adaptive kernel density estimation outputs by using the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(kde_Osun_functional.bw, main = \"Fixed bandwidth\")\nplot(wp_Osun_functional_adaptive, main = \"Adaptive bandwidth\")\n\n\n\n\nNonfunctional waterpoint distribution in fixed and adaptive kernel density estimation outputs\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(kde_Osun_nonfunctional.bw, main = \"Fixed bandwidth\")\nplot(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_adaptive, main = \"Adaptive bandwidth\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to convert the KDE output so that it is suitable for mapping purposes\n\nkde_functionalwp_raster <- kde_Osun_functional.bw  %>%\n  as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im() %>%\n  raster()\nkde_functionalwp_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.8948485, 0.9616045  (x, y)\nextent     : 176.5032, 291.0438, 331.4347, 454.5201  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : v \nvalues     : -5.092436e-15, 25.49435  (min, max)\n\n\n\nkde_nonfunctionalwp_raster <- kde_Osun_nonfunctional.bw  %>%\n  as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im() %>%\n  raster()\nkde_nonfunctionalwp_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.8948485, 0.9616045  (x, y)\nextent     : 176.5032, 291.0438, 331.4347, 454.5201  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : NA \nsource     : memory\nnames      : v \nvalues     : -3.925434e-15, 20.49412  (min, max)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprojection(kde_functionalwp_raster) <- CRS('+init=EPSG:26392')\nprojection(kde_nonfunctionalwp_raster) <- CRS('+init=EPSG:26392')\nkde_functionalwp_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.8948485, 0.9616045  (x, y)\nextent     : 176.5032, 291.0438, 331.4347, 454.5201  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=4 +lon_0=8.5 +k=0.99975 +x_0=670553.98 +y_0=0 +a=6378249.145 +rf=293.465 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : v \nvalues     : -5.092436e-15, 25.49435  (min, max)\n\nkde_nonfunctionalwp_raster\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 128, 128, 16384  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 0.8948485, 0.9616045  (x, y)\nextent     : 176.5032, 291.0438, 331.4347, 454.5201  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=4 +lon_0=8.5 +k=0.99975 +x_0=670553.98 +y_0=0 +a=6378249.145 +rf=293.465 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : v \nvalues     : -3.925434e-15, 20.49412  (min, max)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functional water point distribution\n\ntmap_mode('view')\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_basemap('OpenStreetMap') +\ntm_shape(kde_functionalwp_raster) +\n  tm_raster('v') + \n  tm_layout(legend.position = c('right', 'bottom'), \n            frame = FALSE)\n\nlegend.postion is used for plot mode.

When compare these two maps above (functional waterpoint distribution and non functional waterpoint distribution), we found the north part of Osun has more functional waterpoints than the south part of Osun\n\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_shape(NGA_Osun) + \n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(wp_Osun)+ \n  tm_dots(col = \"status_clean\",\n             size = 0.01,\n             border.col = \"black\",\n             border.lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(8, 16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the graph has too many colors and it will be better if we group them only in Functional, Nonfunctional, Unknown, so it will be clear to visualize\n\nwp_Osun <- wp_Osun %>%\n  mutate(status_group = recode(status_clean,\n                               \"Functional\" = \"Functional\",\n                               \"Functional but not in use\" = \"Functional\",\n                               \"Functional but needs repair\" = \"Functional\",\n                               \"Abandoned/Decommissioned\" = \"Nonfunctional\",\n                               \"Abandoned\" = \"Nonfunctional\",\n                               \"Non-Functional due to dry season\" = \"Nonfunctional\",\n                               \"Non-Functional\" = \"Nonfunctional\",\n                               \"Non functional due to dry season\" = \"Nonfunctional\",\n                               \"unknown\" = \"Unknown\"))\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_shape(NGA_Osun) + \n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(wp_Osun)+ \n  tm_dots(col = \"status_group\",\n             size = 0.01,\n             border.col = \"black\",\n             border.lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(8, 16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(kde_Osun_functional.bw, main = \"Functional Waterpoint\")\n\n\n\nplot(kde_Osun_nonfunctional.bw, main = \"Nonfunctional Waterpoint\")\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of kernel density map over point map:\nKernel density map can provide us with a clear representation of the spatial data distribution. It provides a smooth representation of the underlying distribution and make sure the visualization of areas with a high concentration of points is clear, while point maps can be misleading because they may over-represent areas with many points and under-represent areas with fewer points. In our case, we can see when there are so many points on the graph of point map, it is very hard to observe and interpret.\n\n\n\n\nL function is a tool used to analyze spatial point patterns. It is a summary statistic that provides information on the spatial distribution of points.The L function can be used to identify clustering or regularity in the distribution of points, as well as to assess the spatial randomness of the point pattern.\nHere is the code to\n\n\n\n#to run this code, remove the'#'\n#L_ck = Lest(wp_Osun_functional_ppp, correction = \"Ripley\")\n#plot(L_ck, . -r ~ r, \n     #ylab= \"L(d)-r\", xlab = \"d(m)\")\n\n\n\n#L_ck = Lest(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp, correction = \"Ripley\")\n#plot(L_ck, . -r ~ r, \n     #ylab= \"L(d)-r\", xlab = \"d(m)\")\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Performing Complete Spatial Randomness Test\nTo confirm the observed spatial patterns above, a hypothesis test will be conducted. The hypothesis and test are as follows:\nHo = The distribution of the functional/nonfunctional water point in Osun are randomly distributed.\nH1= The distribution of the functional/nonfunctional water point in Osun are not randomly distributed.\nThe null hypothesis will be rejected if p-value if smaller than alpha value of 0.001.\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the hypothesis testing.\nThe L function is a variance-stabilising transformation of the K function:\n\nMethodology and Interpretation\nTo assess the spatial point pattern, (L(r)−r) will be plotted against r\nAt complete spatial randomness (CSR), L(r)−r=0\nL(r)–r>0 implies clustering\nL(r)−r<0 implies dispersion\n\n#L_ck.csr <- envelope(wp_Osun_functional_ppp, Lest, nsim = 5, rank = 1, glocal=TRUE)\n\n\n#plot(L_ck.csr, . - r ~ r, xlab=\"d\", ylab=\"L(d)-r\")\n\n\n\n#L_ck.csr <- envelope(wp_Osun_nonfunctional_ppp, Lest, nsim = 5, rank = 1, glocal=TRUE)\n\n\n#plot(L_ck.csr, . - r ~ r, xlab=\"d\", ylab=\"L(d)-r\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe L(r)−r function for both functional and nonfunctional water points in Osun (black line) lies above the L(r)−r function at CSR (red line), suggesting clustering. Meanwhile, all of the observed L(r)−r values go above of the randomisation envelope, suggesting statistically significant clustering of both functional and nonfunctional waterpoints in Osun\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, st_knn() of sfdep package is used to determine the k (i.e. 6) nearest neighbours for given point geometry.\n\nnb <- include_self(\n  st_knn(st_geometry(wp_Osun), 6))\n\nst_kernel_weights() of sfdep package is used to derive a weights list by using a kernel function.\n\nwt <- st_kernel_weights(nb, \n                        wp_Osun, \n                        \"gaussian\", \n                        adaptive = TRUE)\n\nTo compute LCLQ by using sfdep package, the reference point data must be in either character or vector list. The code chunks below are used to prepare two vector lists. One of FunctionalWaterpoint and NonFunctionalWaterpoint are called A and B respectively.\n\nFunctionalWaterpoint <- wp_Osun %>%\nfilter(status_group == \"Functional\")\nA<- FunctionalWaterpoint$status_group\n\n\nNonFunctionalWaterpoint <- wp_Osun %>%\nfilter(status_group == \"Nonfunctional\")\nB <- NonFunctionalWaterpoint$status_group\n\nlocal_colocation() us used to compute the LCLQ values for each NonFunctional water point event.\n\nLCLQ <- local_colocation(B, A, nb, wt, 49)\n\nJoining output table\n\nLCLQ_waterpoint <- cbind(wp_Osun, LCLQ)\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\ntm_shape(NGA_Osun) +\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(LCLQ_waterpoint)+ \n  tm_dots(col = \"p_sim_Functional\",\n             size = 0.01,\n             border.col = \"black\",\n             border.lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(8, 16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, the water point with p-value is small (less than 0.05) is highlighted in color, for the above code, we use non-functional waterpoint as our Category of Interest, the point highlighted in yellow color means that the actual co-location quotient for those nonfunctional water points is statistically significant. Those non-functional water point are surrounded with functional water points and should be carefully examined"
